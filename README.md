# Gutenberg Word2Vec

Creating word2vec embeddings/word vectors from open source book data from Project Gutenberg, using Gensim, NLTK and Python.

Currently trained on [this large dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/terminate9298/gutenberg-poetry-dataset) of over 2 million lines of poetry. Many thanks to the creator of the dataset!
